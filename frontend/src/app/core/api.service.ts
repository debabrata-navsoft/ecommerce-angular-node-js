 * `service.doThing()` as "it happened" and never subscribe. Under a cold observable those
 * calls silently do nothing, which is how an optimistic signal update could show a
 * wishlist item that was never persisted and vanished on refresh.
 *
 * `shareReplay` with `refCount: false` keeps the single in-flight request alive and
 * replays its result, so a caller that *does* subscribe (or subscribes late) still gets
 * the response without triggering a second request.
 *
 * Use this for fire-and-forget mutations. Leave reads, and flows whose caller always
 * subscribes (login, signup), cold.
